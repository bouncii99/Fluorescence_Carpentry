# Standardization-of-fluorescence-in-cells
Given a confocal image, one can use this code in order to quantify of polarization/localisation of a fluorescence tagged protein. 

Upon executing the current python script, an image of the cell boundary will be returned.
This boundary will then be used to find the centroid.
