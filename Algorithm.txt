Final Project Algorithm: 

    1. Import image to python
    2. Initialize a Gaussian Image filter to reduce noise - this will return a smoothened image
    3. Smooth image using sobel kernels - horizontal and vertical/Laplacian Derivatives
    4. Use nonmaximum suppression to thin out the edges 
    5. Use hysterisis thersholding - define what edges are and what are not. Figure out standard Min and Max values.
    6. Read the above image and scan the image to store all the edge points. Try and use openCV and PIL to ease life.
    
This is the milestone.
